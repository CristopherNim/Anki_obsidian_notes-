# what to know before buying 
## Research the Seller

Before heading to the lot, try to learn as much about the seller as possible. A well-established seller should have reviews or testimonials available online.

For smaller or newer dealers, do as much research as possible to learn more about them. It might help to ask colleagues and business partners if they’ve had experience with this seller, or track down information from past customers. Their experience in the industry is another sign of credibility – someone who’s been selling heavy equipment for a long time, or is part of a family business, will be a safer bet than someone who’s new to the scene.

Pro tip: Any trustworthy seller will let you test the equipment before you make a decision. If the seller bars you from taking a test drive, they may be hiding something from you.

## Examine the Machine’s History

Checking the ownership history is an excellent way to tell if you’re getting a good deal. If equipment has changed hands frequently, it might be underused or poorly maintained. But if it’s been with one owner throughout its operating life, it’s likely the owner took good care of it.

Additionally, you should look out for ownership issues, such as liens and seizure of equipment. Liens are problematic because they can interfere with your legal rights as the machine’s owner. Seized equipment is also concerning – it means the equipment was taken from a buyer who could not pay in full, so maintenance was probably spotty at 
best.

### Maintenance Record

The machine’s maintenance record should tell you everything you need to know about its condition. A detailed record of proper maintenance reduces the chance that you’ll encounter surprises during use.

The previous owner should have recorded the following:

- Fluid changes
- Any repairs, major or minor
- Issues experienced during normal operation
- Any current replacement needs

Pay extra attention to the frequency of past repairs. If one part is consistently experiencing serious issues, chances are high you’ll have the same problem moving forward.

he founders of Boom & Bucket had an “aha moment” after talking to customers, dozens of customers. They discovered that every customer they spoke to was unhappy with the used heavy equipment they had purchased for various reasons, such as overpaying, misrepresented conditions, and feeling scammed by financing. This led to the realization that customers were terribly dissatisfied with the experience of purchasing heavy equipment, which inspired the idea for their current company.
