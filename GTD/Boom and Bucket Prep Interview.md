# what to know before buying 
## Research the Seller

Before heading to the lot, try to learn as much about the seller as possible. A well-established seller should have reviews or testimonials available online.

For smaller or newer dealers, do as much research as possible to learn more about them. It might help to ask colleagues and business partners if they’ve had experience with this seller, or track down information from past customers. Their experience in the industry is another sign of credibility – someone who’s been selling heavy equipment for a long time, or is part of a family business, will be a safer bet than someone who’s new to the scene.

Pro tip: Any trustworthy seller will let you test the equipment before you make a decision. If the seller bars you from taking a test drive, they may be hiding something from you.

## Examine the Machine’s History

Checking the ownership history is an excellent way to tell if you’re getting a good deal. If equipment has changed hands frequently, it might be underused or poorly maintained. But if it’s been with one owner throughout its operating life, it’s likely the owner took good care of it.

Additionally, you should look out for ownership issues, such as liens and seizure of equipment. Liens are problematic because they can interfere with your legal rights as the machine’s owner. Seized equipment is also concerning – it means the equipment was taken from a buyer who could not pay in full, so maintenance was probably spotty at best.

### Maintenance Record

The machine’s maintenance record should tell you everything you need to know about its condition. A detailed record of proper maintenance reduces the chance that you’ll encounter surprises during use.

The previous owner should have recorded the following:

- Fluid changes
- Any repairs, major or minor
- Issues experienced during normal operation
- Any current replacement needs

Pay extra attention to the frequency of past repairs. If one part is consistently experiencing serious issues, chances are high you’ll have the same problem moving forward.

They discovered that every customer they spoke to was unhappy with the used heavy equipment they had purchased for various reasons, such as overpaying, misrepresented conditions, and feeling scammed by financing. This led to the realization that customers were terribly dissatisfied with the experience of purchasing heavy equipment, which inspired the idea for their current company.

What is Section 179? Section 179 is a tax deduction aimed at motivating small and medium-sized businesses to invest in equipment and other qualitying assets. It enables businesses to deduct the entire purchase price of these assets in the year they enter service, eliminating the need for gradual depreciation. However, changes to Section 179 are coming in late 2023. The deduction limit, which stood at $1,050,000 in 2022, is set to decrease to $500,000 in 2023 and the phase-out threshold of $2.62 million in 2022, will decline to $2.5 million in 2023. This means businesses with qualifying equipment purchases exceeding $2.5 million will see a reduction in their allowable deduction. With Section 179 changes looming, it's essential to keep up with its evolving landscape to make the most of those tax benefits. Our webinar will give you the insights you need to navigate these changes effectively. Join us to understand how these adjustments will affect your business and how to make the most of them.

Section 179 is indeed an essential tax provision for many businesses in the United States. At its core, it allows businesses to deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment and/or software purchased or financed during the tax year. This deduction is advantageous because, rather than depreciating assets over several years, businesses can deduct the full amount in the year they're purchased.

However, as you mentioned, there are adjustments set for 2023 that businesses should be aware of. The deduction limit and phase-out threshold are expected to decrease, which may affect the purchasing strategies of businesses that plan to invest significantly in equipment or other qualifying assets. As the landscape of Section 179 changes, businesses need to be strategic about their investments to optimize their tax benefits.

Your upcoming webinar sounds like a valuable resource for businesses looking to navigate these changes. By understanding the potential impacts on their tax situation, companies can make more informed decisions about their investments and financial planning.
