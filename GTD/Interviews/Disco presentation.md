## Random thoughts that might help
- Most people think that data is a lot of numbers. When in reality, data should be used to tell stories using words. Disco software gathers all the data from the law firm to help each lawyer tell a story. Being able to search the data using keywords would help accelerate cases allowing lawyers to use their time in other places instead of using time collecting data

What caught your eye about disco

My name is Cris, and with Disco. I'm looking to get in touch with the office manager or a decision-maker. would that be you? 

The reason for my call is to schedule a meeting. I understand that many lawyers still rely on binders, highlighter, and sticky notes. Nothing is wrong with that. That slows the process in the ligation cycle because each team member works on their own binders. I know if each person could share data in real-time, it would help improve the discovery phase in the litigation cycle significantly. With Disco software, you can share data in real-time for your team to build a strong deposition to wow the judges. Let's schedule a demo for tomorrow at 3 p.m.
