# Fallen dreams 
I have fallen apart this month. I had high hopes at the start of the month. I went back to my bad habits. I sat down for hours, trying to understand what happen and what made me go back to my bad habits. Could it have been stressed, or was I just lazy? I know I want it bad enough. I know I want to succeed. Then why can't I work for hours. I need to rethink my whole work ethic system. I am not doing a good job at being organized. I need to plan out my weekend accordingly. I will master my mind and give everything I have to succeed. When someone asks me what it took to get to this point, I will tell them it took everything.

# My goals that I WILL NOT ACCOMPLISH BECAUSE OF MY WORK ETHIC

1. I will not learn how to swim
2. I will not learn how to surf
3. I will not know what it feels like to run a 50 or 100-mile marathon
4. I will not climb a mountain
5. I will waste my life away looking at porn and thinking of how I failed.
