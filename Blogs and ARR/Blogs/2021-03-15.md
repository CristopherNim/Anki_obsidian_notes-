# Today Mindset and feelings 
Mentally I feel good. I have a good mindset. I ran 2.24 miles and I feel good physically. I do have the urge to watch porn and masturbate. I just realized that masturbate has the word master in the beginning. I will think about mastering my mind every time I feel this way. The reason I was successful today was because I got up right away. If I can push through this day I will look back tomorrow and smile at what I accomplish.  ✊️ 🙋‍♂️️
