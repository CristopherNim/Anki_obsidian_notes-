# Random Writing

`I have no idea what to write about today. I'll go ahead and write about what I am thinking. Yesterday I went on social media for about 8 hours, probably. By the end of the day, I felt empty. Felt like all my dopamine was sucked out of me, and nothing I did would fill up that empty void I had created. Social media has an effect on me that I cannot describe. Today I have no desire to go on social media, but my head and hands want to grab the rectangular object and browse for happiness. I think my mind wants to be lazy and take the easy way out by taking the short-term pleasure instead of working for that long-term happiness. I refuse to be weak and let my mind give in to my short-term craving. I will grab a book and read instead of going on social media. I will study for 8 hours and not be on social media. I will do 200 push-ups, 100 pull-ups, 30 minutes of jump rope, and I will not go on social media. `
