Tell me about a time when you had used your analytical prowess to resolve a problem?

**Situation** - I was the lead problem solver at singles pack area. The warehouse was just recently build. We were missing Critical pull Items which are packages that need to be in the truck at a certain time. My manager ask me to find a solution to have the least amount of Critical Pull Items missed. 

**Task** Task was to get the Critical pull items at the truck before the deadline. My goal was not have critical pull items missed.

**Action** My goal was to get all the problem solvers and slam operators to work together in order not to have any critical pull items missed. I had to apply amazon leadership principles specifically ==ownership==. First I talked to each slam operator and told them why they were important and essential to not have any critical pull items missed. I urge and challgenge them to ==simplify and invent== ways to figure out how to keep there area clean and find critical pull items. I ask the waterspider to scan totes that contain Critical pull items to give to the packers to pack out. I explain to them the importance role they play into not having any CPI missed. I also told them that they could eventually move up to being a problem solver.  

**Result** At first we were only missing a couple of CPI, but we kept improving until we were no longer missing any CPI's.

When did you take a risk, make a mistake, or fail? How did you respond, and how did you grow from that experience?

> When I started my first project  that involve data analyzing, I was overly eager to go the extra mile. So much so that I agreed to take on unrealistic deadlines with coworkers. I was late completing at least one task each week, and my coworkers were not happy with me. After that experience, I devised a tracking system to make sure I knew how long each task would realistically take, and made sure never to fall behind again. I understand now that it’s better to give a longer timeline and be early than promise the moon and fail to deliver.

What did you do when you needed to motivate a group of individuals or promote collaboration on a particular project?

-   **Situation:** When I was a student at WGU. we were assigned a project that original had 8 people, but 3 of them dropped out. The 5-person team I led was demoralized and also needed to absorb the additional work from the departed students. 
-   **Action:** I had zoom meetings with each one of them. These one-on-one meetings were an opportunity to vent, but also created space for employees to share pain points. I shared all the potential roadblocks in a follow-up team meeting, and we brainstormed solutions together, including adjusting the timeline slightly. I created a trello board based on everyone feedback.
-   **Results:** In the end, the project was submitted, just a week behind the original schedule, and without any other issues. Because the team felt that their frustrations were acknowledged, there was no simmering resentment holding people back. Instead, the team felt enthusiastic and unified in a common goal.
