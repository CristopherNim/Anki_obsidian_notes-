I did a  good job working and staying consistent. I loved that I am losing the habit of looking at email at computer. moving all the bad habits to the Ipad should help. I am just scared that I will look at porn when I am lazy. 

One thing I need to be better is waking and getting to work right away. I'll set up my desk at the standing version to motivate me to work right away. I'll download lofi music and have coffee ready before I go to sleep.
