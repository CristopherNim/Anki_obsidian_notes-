ARR 

I had a rough day in my opinion. I need to read a book at night then head to sleep. I need to stop masturbating and watching clash royal afterwards. If I can beat that urge then I will be successful. I notice that overtime I put on my glasses and headphones my mind tells me I have to get to work. I also need to put jeans on in order to add resistance to not masturbate. I am doing a good surrounding the bed so I do not lay on it. keep working on those habit.
