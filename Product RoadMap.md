Product vision 
- “ We think of a product vision as how a specific sort of customer will benefit from your product when it is fully realized and ubiquitous.”
 
Business Objective 
 - What are the goals your product will accomplish? The outcomes? What will be measurably different for your organization? 

Company Vision - The reason the product might even exist at all. This provides the groundwork

Components of a road map:
 - Company vision
 - critical factor
 - product vision 
	 - problems
		 - working with potential customers should reveal the most important problems 
		 - set of problems can easily form a set of themes to guide the backbone of the roadmap
- The first theme only contains the details about the features you'll actually ship

Secondary components are optional but will enhance the roadmap in important ways to certain stakeholders.

# Themes 
- Features and solutions 
- Stage of development
	- “Stakeholders seeing labels like “discovery,” “design,” or “prototyping” on a roadmap should understand that the product is in a very early stage of development. They may be able to see and provide input on sketches, layouts, material choices, and other design aspects before they are finalized. A label like “pre-production” or “beta,” conversely, should convey that the product can be touched (or at least seen) and demonstrated, and is likely to be generally available soon
- Confidence in delivering your product
- Target Customers 
- Product areas 
	- “A large and complex product—or a new product where basic functionality is still being laid down in many areas—may benefit from a roadmap where themes or features are annotated by product area. Individual product areas may also have separate business objectives.
- secondary components 
	- optional deliverable 


# Types of information 
- Project information 
	- Schedule , resources, status, dependencies, risks development team, executives 
	- platform considerations, scalability requirements, infrastructure needs, developments team, technical platform
	- financial information, market opportunity, P&L, executives, investors, board of directors
	- external drivers, regulatory changes, competition, events, legal, compliance 

**“A full production schedule is not part of the roadmap, but a quick mention of the number one risk can spark the right sort of conversation with internal stakeholders who may be able to help mitigate this risk.” **

==“All, however, incorporate core concepts such as what is coming and approximately when (or at least in what order). The most effective ones provide context about why by including an explicit statement of product vision and a set of outcome-oriented themes, together with a disclaimer making it clear all of this is subject to change.==

==The best roadmaps don’t obscure the core message with a lot of extraneous detail, but home in on the additional context most important to particular stakeholders.==
