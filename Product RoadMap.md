Product vision 
- “ We think of a product vision as how a specific sort of customer will benefit from your product when it is fully realized and ubiquitous.”
 
Business Objective 
 - What are the goals your product will accomplish? The outcomes? What will be measurably different for your organization? 

Company Vision - The reason the product might even exist at all. This provides the groundwork

Components of a road map:
 - Company vision
 - critical factor
 - product vision 
	 - problems
		 - working with potential customers should reveal the most important problems 
		 - set of problems can easily form a set of themes to guide the backbone of the roadmap
- The first theme only contains the details about the features you'll actually ship

Secondary components are optional but will enhance the roadmap in important ways to certain stakeholders.

# Themes 
- Features and solutions 
- Stage of development
	- “Stakeholders seeing labels like “discovery,” “design,” or “prototyping” on a roadmap should understand that the product is in a very early stage of development. They may be able to see and provide input on sketches, layouts, material choices, and other design aspects before they are finalized. A label like “pre-production” or “beta,” conversely, should convey that the product can be touched (or at least seen) and demonstrated, and is likely to be generally available soon
- Confidence in delivering your product
- Target Customers 
- Product areas 
	- “A large and complex product—or a new product where basic functionality is still being laid down in many areas—may benefit from a roadmap where themes or features are annotated by product area. Individual product areas may also have separate business objectives.
- secondary components 
	- optional deliverable 


# Types of information 
- Project information 
	- Schedule , resources, status, dependencies, risks development team, executives 
	- platform considerations, scalability requirements, infrastructure needs, developments team, technical platform
	- financial information, market opportunity, P&L, executives, investors, board of directors
	- external drivers, regulatory changes, competition, events, legal, compliance 

**“A full production schedule is not part of the roadmap, but a quick mention of the number one risk can spark the right sort of conversation with internal stakeholders who may be able to help mitigate this risk.” **

==“All, however, incorporate core concepts such as what is coming and approximately when (or at least in what order). The most effective ones provide context about why by including an explicit statement of product vision and a set of outcome-oriented themes, together with a disclaimer making it clear all of this is subject to change.==

==The best roadmaps don’t obscure the core message with a lot of extraneous detail, but home in on the additional context most important to particular stakeholders.==

# gathering inputs 

- “The goal of gathering inputs is to make sure you have all of the relevant information and context you need to make good product decisions.
- Without a constant refresh of that context, you’ll risk making too many assumptions and mistakes. As part of this process you’ll likely have lots of discussions and negotiations with your stakeholders.”
- Product lifecycle 
	- New
		- “ Your roadmap in this phase of the life cycle should be used to outline and drive the creation of the first version of your product.
		- With a new product, you are venturing into uncharted territory. This means you will have to make a lot of assumptions, and then rapidly prototype and test to get validation and answers. That validation, or lack thereof, will ultimately impact what themes or features make it onto your roadmap.
	- Growth
		- The second phase in the life cycle is scaling an existing product. This means getting it to as many customers as possible. For example, when R. Colin Kennedy was Product Manager at Sonos, the objective for the year was to get as many product (speaker) installations as possible
	- Expansion 
		- “ When Kayak started, it did one simple thing: it allowed users to search for flights across multiple airlines at the same time, filter options, and compare costs. Once Kayak established itself in the market, it realized this format would also work for hotels and cars
	- Harvesting
		- “The fourth life-cycle phase we want to mention is the “cash cow product” that simply needs to be maintained 
	- End of life - monitoring how the project is doing 

### Gathering inputs from your customers 
 - understand who your customer are
### customers roles 
- “user roles focus on jobs and functions. In other words, a user role describes the primary action taken by a particular user. 
- “you must get out of the building and interact with them directly to understand what they’re thinking, feeling, seeing, hearing, saying, and doing”

# chapter 4 
### The mission - the purpose (must be achievable)
what can you do for the customers

### Vision is the outcome you seek
 - long term goals 
 - who wants this
 - why would they need this 
 - how is the product unique 
 - must make the customer feel like they belong 
	 - I want to lease something in order to feel like I belong in this store 

### values are your compass

### product vision - why your products exists 

### OKR (business objectives and key results)
**only 3 to 5 OKR are needed**
- Everything on the roadmap must be tied to at least one of your objectives.
- Stick to a manageable number of objectives; from our experience and research, fewer than five seems to be most effective
- Focus on outcomes and not outputs

“Each of these themes is tied to an objective that can then be measured by specific key results, and their roadmap reflects this.

# chapter 5
“A theme is a high-level customer need. A subtheme is a more specific need. Themes can stand on their own”

“Theme: Address key usability issues
Subtheme: Pagination
Subtheme: Menu navigation
Subtheme: Save status

Theme: 
Indestructibility
Subtheme: No kinks
Subtheme: No leaks
