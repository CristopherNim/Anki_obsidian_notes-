Product vision 
- “ We think of a product vision as how a specific sort of customer will benefit from your product when it is fully realized and ubiquitous.”
 
Business Objective 
 - What are the goals your product will accomplish? The outcomes? What will be measurably different for your organization? 

Company Vision - The reason the product might even exist at all. This provides the groundwork

Components of a road map:
 - Company vision
 - critical factor
 - product vision 
	 - problems
		 - working with potential customers should reveal the most important problems 
		 - set of problems can easily form a set of themes to guide the backbone of the roadmap
- The first theme only contains the details about the features you'll actually ship

Secondary components are optional but will enhance the roadmap in important ways to certain stakeholders.
