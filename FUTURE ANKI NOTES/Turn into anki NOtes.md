Multicollinearity generally occurs when there are high correlations between two or more predictor variables. In other words, one predictor variable can be used to predict the other. This creates redundant information, skewing the results in a regression model. Examples of correlated predictor variables (also called multicollinear predictors) are: a person’s height and weight, age and sales price of a car, or years of education and annual income.
- It’s more common for multicollineariy to rear its ugly head in observational studies; it’s less common with experimental data.
- The t-statistic will generally be very small and coefficient confidence intervals will be very wide. This means that it is harder to reject the null hypothesis.
- The partial regression coefficient may be an imprecise estimate; standard errors may be very large.
- Partial regression coefficients may have sign and/or magnitude changes as they pass from sample to sample.
- Multicollinearity makes it difficult to gauge the effect of independent variables on dependent variables.
